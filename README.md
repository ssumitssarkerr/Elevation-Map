# Elevation Map: Coastal Bangladesh Flood Vulnerability

This repository contains an **Elevation Map** of the coastal regions of **Comilla, Noakhali, and Feni** in Bangladesh. The map is a key tool for visualizing land vulnerability to flooding, storm surges, and the impacts of climate change.

## Understanding Flood Vulnerability

Elevation relative to mean sea level is used to classify areas according to their flood risk. This analysis provides essential guidance for planning and resilience. It identifies suitable locations for development while minimizing exposure to inundation, highlights higher-elevation zones that can serve as safe refuges during floods, and informs the design and placement of climate-resilient infrastructure such as roads, embankments, and housing.

## Elevation Legend and Vulnerability

| Color | Elevation (m) | Vulnerability Level | Planning Implication |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Dark Blue** | < 1 | **Very High** | Highly exposed; priority for protection and adaptation. |
| **Light Blue** | 1 – 3 | **High** | Highly exposed; requires robust protective measures. |
| **Green** | 3 – 5 | **Moderate** | Important transition zone. |
| **Yellow** | 5 – 10 | **Low** | Supports safer land use and infrastructure. |
| **Red** | > 10 | **Very Low** | Ideal for permanent refuge and critical infrastructure. |

**Key Finding:** Areas with low elevation below 3 m are extremely vulnerable to flooding, storm surges, and sea-level rise, requiring urgent protective measures. Moderate to higher elevation zones from 3 to 10 m and above 10 m offer safer ground for settlements, infrastructure, and strategic planning, making them critical for resilient land use and disaster preparedness.
